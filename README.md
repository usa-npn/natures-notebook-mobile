# natures-notebook-mobile
This is the Nature's Notebook mobile app codebase for Android and iOS. The app allows citizen scientists to make phenological observations for plants and animals at either personal or group sites and syncs those observations over to the [USA National Phenology Network's database](https://www.usanpn.org/data/observational). 

The app uses the [Nativescript](https://www.nativescript.org) framework meaning the app is basically written once in [Angular](https://angular.io) and can be compiled into native app experiences on both Android and iOS.

See [here](https://www.usanpn.org/natures_notebook) for more information on the Nature's Notebook program and [here](https://www.usanpn.org/nn/mobile-app) for more information on using the mobile app.
